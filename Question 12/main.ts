// Exercise no 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message 
// to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


   
{let names = ["Ramzan", "Sheraz", "David", "Charli", "Daniyal"];

names.forEach(name => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Have a great day!`);
})};
