// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

    let languages = ["English","Urdu","Punjabi","Sindhi","Bangali","Pashto"]

    // Printing the list of mountains
